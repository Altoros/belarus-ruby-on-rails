    operators: '<p>Some good operators:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>#item</b> - hastag search operator</li>
        <li><b>from:USERID</b> - search for anything tweeted by @USERID</li>
        <li><b>filter:links</b> - When you add this to your query, it will return only results with links. Pretty useful to search for resources :D</li>
        <li><b>:)</b> and <b>:(</b> and <b>?</b> - They search for positive / negative / question attitude in the results. Pretty awesome, it should be an international operator in all search engines</li>
        <li><b>-item</b> (minus) - This is the “not” operator. It excludes all “item” from search.</li>
      </ul>'
